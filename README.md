# Sticker Scheme! üè∑Ô∏è
Sticeker Scheme is a scheme where out of all the people who sign-up for Code Hub, 5 people will be randomly seleceted from our own-built engine and these lucky five will get stickers and a personal note from the founder delivered anywhere in india!, the engine uses python and other modules to determine the winners!

# How it works?
Firstly after we have finalized all the sign-ups, we will transfer all the data to an excel sheet thorgh which the engine will work, then we will store all the names in the first column cells and use those cells to obtain the names, then a number is randomly generated based on the max rows and the number which will correspond to a name in the sheet will be chosen and a tick(‚úîÔ∏è) will appear beside their names, signifying that they are the winners in the raffle!
